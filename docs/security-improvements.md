# Database Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the VitaK Tracker database.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Service Role Key Exposure
**Issue**: The service role key was being used in frontend-accessible code, bypassing all Row Level Security.
**Fix**: 
- Created separate `supabase-server.ts` with proper authentication
- Service role only used for system operations (webhooks)
- All user-facing operations use proper authenticated clients

### 2. Authentication Mismatch
**Issue**: RLS policies used Supabase's `auth.uid()` but we use Clerk for authentication.
**Fix**:
- Created `set_current_user()` function to set Clerk user ID
- Updated all RLS policies to check both app context and JWT claims
- Proper user context propagation

### 3. Missing Security Features
**Issue**: No rate limiting, audit logging, or proper validation.
**Fix**:
- Added rate limiting for all database operations
- Created audit log table for sensitive operations
- Implemented secure database functions with validation

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never use service role in frontend code**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ BAD
   import { supabaseAdmin } from "@/lib/db/supabase";
   
   // ✅ GOOD
   import { createServerSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/db/supabase-server";
   ```

2. **Always use rate limiting**
   ```typescript
   checkRateLimit(userId, "operation", RATE_LIMITS.OPERATION);
   ```

3. **Use secure database functions for sensitive operations**
   ```typescript
   // Use RPC calls for validated operations
   await supabase.rpc("insert_meal_log", { ... });
   ```

### Database Security Checklist

- [ ] RLS enabled on all tables
- [ ] Policies use proper user identification
- [ ] Service role only for system operations
- [ ] Rate limiting on all operations
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive actions
- [ ] Input validation at database level
- [ ] No direct SQL string concatenation

## Migration Instructions

1. Run the new migrations:
   ```bash
   bun push:migration
   ```

2. Update all imports from `supabaseAdmin` to use `createServerSupabaseClient()`

3. Test RLS policies are working:
   - Users can only see their own data
   - Service operations still work via webhooks

## Monitoring

Monitor these for security issues:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual data access patterns
- Audit log anomalies

## Future Improvements

1. Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
2. Add IP-based rate limiting
3. Implement data retention policies
4. Add anomaly detection for suspicious patterns
5. Regular security audits
