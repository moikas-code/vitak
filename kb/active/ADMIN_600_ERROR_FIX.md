# Admin Page 600 Error Fix

## Issue
User reported getting a "600 error" when visiting the admin page. This was caused by:
1. Client-side DOM manipulation in the admin layout using `document.getElementById` and onClick handlers
2. Hydration mismatches between server and client rendering
3. No proper error boundaries to catch and display errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Separated Admin Layout Components
- Created `admin-auth-wrapper.tsx` for server-side authentication checks
- Created `admin-client-layout.tsx` for client-side UI with proper React state
- Updated main `layout.tsx` to compose both components

### 2. Fixed React State Management
- Replaced direct DOM manipulation with React `useState`
- Used proper event handlers instead of inline onClick with getElementById
- Added useEffect for handling click-outside behavior

### 3. Added Error Handling
- Created `app/admin/error.tsx` for admin-specific error handling
- Added ErrorBoundary component wrapper around admin content
- Enhanced error logging with proper context

### 4. Improved Error Messages
- Added try-catch blocks in admin stats fetching
- Provided helpful error messages for common issues
- Development mode shows detailed error information

## Files Modified
- `/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Main layout composition
- `/app/admin/admin-auth-wrapper.tsx` - Server-side auth checks (new)
- `/app/admin/admin-client-layout.tsx` - Client-side UI logic (new)
- `/app/admin/error.tsx` - Error boundary page (new)
- `/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added error handling to stats fetching

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passing
- ESLint: ✅ No errors or warnings

## Next Steps
1. Deploy changes to production
2. Monitor for any hydration warnings in console
3. Check if the "600 error" is resolved

The mysterious "600 error" was likely a browser-specific error or custom error related to the DOM manipulation issues, not a standard HTTP status code.
