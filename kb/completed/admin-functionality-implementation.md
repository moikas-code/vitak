Successfully implemented a comprehensive admin system for VitaK Tracker with role-based access control, food management, user management, and audit logging.

## Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅

- Added audit fields to foods table: `created_by`, `updated_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Created `food_audit_log` table with comprehensive tracking
- Implemented RLS policies for admin-only access to audit logs

### 2. Authentication & Authorization ✅
- Updated Clerk webhook to sync roles from `publicMetadata`
- Created `adminProcedure` in tRPC for admin-only endpoints
- Implemented role-based middleware protection
- Added role validation in tRPC context

### 3. Admin API Endpoints ✅
**Food Management:**

- Automatic logging of all admin actions
- IP address and user agent tracking

### 4. Admin UI Implementation ✅
**Layout & Navigation:**
- Admin layout at `/app/admin/layout.tsx`
- Sidebar navigation with all sections
- Role verification before rendering

**Pages Created:**
- `/admin` - Dashboard with statistics
- `/admin/foods` - Food management data table
- `/admin/foods/new` - Add new food form
- `/admin/foods/[id]/edit` - Edit food form
- `/admin/users` - User management interface
- `/admin/audit-logs` - Audit log viewer

### 5. Security Implementation ✅
- Middleware protection for `/admin/*` routes
- Role verification in publicMetadata
- Admin-only tRPC procedures
- Self-demotion prevention
- Comprehensive audit logging
- RLS policies on database level

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
bunx supabase migration up
```

### 2. Set Admin Role
Option A - Using script:
```bash
bun run scripts/set-admin.ts YOUR_CLERK_USER_ID
```

Option B - Update Clerk user:
Add to user's publicMetadata in Clerk Dashboard:
```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

### 3. Access Admin Dashboard
Navigate to `/admin` when logged in as an admin user.

## Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified
- Database migration file
- `lib/db/types.ts` - Added UserRole type and new fields
- `lib/trpc/trpc.ts` - Added adminProcedure
- `lib/trpc/routers/admin.ts` - Complete admin router
- `app/api/clerk/webhook/route.ts` - Role sync from Clerk
- `middleware.ts` - Admin route protection
- `components/ui/form.tsx` - Form components
- `components/ui/table.tsx` - Table components
- All admin UI pages

### Architecture Decisions
1. Used Clerk publicMetadata for role storage to maintain single source of truth
2. Implemented audit logging at API level for consistency
3. Used service role client for admin operations to bypass RLS
4. Created separate admin router to keep concerns separated
5. Implemented client-side role switching with server validation

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk export/import UI
- Advanced user analytics
- Role-based feature flags
- Admin activity dashboard
- Email notifications for admin actions

## Migration Path
If upgrading from previous version:
1. Run the migration to add role fields
2. All existing users default to 'user' role
3. Manually promote admins using the script
4. Update Clerk webhook endpoint if needed
